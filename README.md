# Movie Sentiment Analyzer

A web application that analyzes sentiment in movie reviews using machine learning. This project combines a Flask backend with an attractive pastel-colored UI to determine if a movie review is positive or negative.

## About This Project

The Movie Sentiment Analyzer uses machine learning models trained on 50,000 IMDB movie reviews to predict the sentiment of any movie review text. Simply enter a review, and the application will analyze it in real-time, providing you with the sentiment prediction, confidence score, and key phrases that influenced the decision.

The application features a clean, modern interface with a soothing pastel color scheme that works well on both desktop and mobile devices. The dashboard provides insights into the sentiment distribution and model performance metrics.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using Python and Flask for the backend, with scikit-learn for the machine learning components. The frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Bootstrap 5 for responsive design and Chart.js for data visualization.
